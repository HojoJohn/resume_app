        <h3>Evaluation and Analysis:</h3>
        <p>In my investigation into whether our economic growth and ecological footprint have an impact on our future and how humankind will develop it. At the beginning of my investigation when researching the rate of urbanization in America I noticed an exponential climb from the beginning of 1900 to 2000 and you will notice that it has increased by a factor of 1457%. This is relevant since when urbanizing you have to take account that you have to destroy the land and that ruins the ecosystem which destroys the natural system in place. </p><p>Next, I researched the rate of growth in the population that can be accounted for in the world. Starting in 1900 when the total population was 1.6 billion to now in 2019 when it is 7.7 billion this is a growth of 390% in the last century and with my calculation; the growth rate will increase by a factor of 8.1% every year. With this data you can see how in the near future you will not have just passed the carrying capacity of the earth humankind will have overshot it by an enormous amount. But this data is not entirely correct because of free will since my calculation uses the rule that it grows at a constant which is not true. </p> <p>Then, I researched the rate of pollution that has affected America. And in each type of pollution ranging from Ammonia to SOS I have noticed that even though there is still a large amount of pollution that is still on earth, you can see that it has decreased in the last 50 years. Depending on the type of pollution you can see that it has decreased from a little to a lot. This is amazing since pollution is a big reason for a lot of the environmental problems on earth like the destruction of forests, and the destruction of the ozone layer which protects us from harmful radiation but this data is not entirely correct since it doesn’t cover all types of pollution.</p> <p> The final result of the research of data shows how the resources humankind can use are not that much and by some time in the future, they will run out. Since the amount of water can use is only 2.5% of the total amount of water on earth and there is the ever-decreasing pool of oil that is available to us which is only enough for only 46.2 years which is calculated in a constant which would only give you an estimation because of free will. This is only just some examples of the decreasing natural resource humankind has at hand to use.</p>
        
        
        
        
       <p> Conclusion:
        The earth is dying and humankind is 100% responsible for it from our overpopulating to our urbanization of the land which creates pollution and to the use of the limited natural resources that decrease exponentially. Humankind has been making strides to counteract the strain they have put on the earth but they are coming up short since all data points to the earth running out of resources that sustain them in the next century. Solutions that could help with this problem would be the regulation of urbanization, populating, and use of natural resources but this is not a very viable solution since people don’t like being prohibited from doing something. So humankind </p>
