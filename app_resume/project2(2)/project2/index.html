       <p>Since the creation of the first machine; humans have been doing everything to progress and make their lives better even if it destroys the world and its ecosystems. This has escalated from the beginning of the industrial revolution which introduced the first automated machine. </p>
           
    <p>With this humanâ€™s creativeness has increased exponentially which in turn has increased their destructiveness. In the present humankind has destroyed a lot of this earth in the pursuit of their self-gain and comfortability by removing forests and wildlife for their cities, food, and other assorted things. 
    </p>
    <h4>Can this continue or will humankind run out of resources, land, and other stuff that keeps it afloat?</h4>
